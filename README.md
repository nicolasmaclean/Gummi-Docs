# Welcome to Gummi

Gummi is a library for creating games in the Unity game Engine built by me! Nick Maclean. This project contains resources useful for prototyping or just about any project.

The C# library is sorted into 2 sections: core and the rest.

The Core lies in the `Gummi` namespace and provides functionality essential to the entire Gummi library. The rest of the logic is contained in sub-namespaces to `Gummi`.

## Getting Started

See [Installation](installation.md) for how you can add this library to your project!

The `sample~` folder in the package also includes sample scenes useful for seeing common applications of this library.
